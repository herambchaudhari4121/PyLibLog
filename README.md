## Libraries in Python
# Python standard library
The Python Standard Library contains the exact syntax, semantics, and tokens of Python. It contains built-in modules that provide access to basic system functionality like I/O and some other core modules. Most of the Python Libraries are written in the C programming language. The Python standard library consists of more than 200 core modules. All these work together to make Python a high-level programming language. Python Standard Library plays a very important role. Without it, the programmers can‚Äôt have access to the functionalities of Python. But other than this, there are several other libraries in Python that make a programmer‚Äôs life easier. Let‚Äôs have a look at some of the commonly used libraries:

## TensorFlow: This library was developed by Google in collaboration with the Brain Team. It is an open-source library used for high-level computations. It is also used in machine learning and deep learning algorithms. It contains a large number of tensor operations. Researchers also use this Python library to solve complex computations in Mathematics and Physics.
## Matplotlib: This library is responsible for plotting numerical data. And that‚Äôs why it is used in data analysis. It is also an open-source library and plots high-defined figures like pie charts, histograms, scatterplots, graphs, etc.
## Pandas: Pandas are an important library for data scientists. It is an open-source machine learning library that provides flexible high-level data structures and a variety of analysis tools. It eases data analysis, data manipulation, and cleaning of data. Pandas support operations like Sorting, Re-indexing, Iteration, Concatenation, Conversion of data, Visualizations, Aggregations, etc.
## Numpy: The name ‚ÄúNumpy‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúNumerical Python‚Äù. It is the commonly used library. It is a popular machine learning library that supports large matrices and multi-dimensional data. It consists of in-built mathematical functions for easy computations. Even libraries like TensorFlow use Numpy internally to perform several operations on tensors. Array Interface is one of the key features of this library.
## SciPy: The name ‚ÄúSciPy‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúScientific Python‚Äù. It is an open-source library used for high-level scientific computations. This library is built over an extension of Numpy. It works with Numpy to handle complex computations. While Numpy allows sorting and indexing of array data, the numerical data code is stored in SciPy. It is also widely used by application developers and engineers.
## Scrapy: It is an open-source library that is used for extracting data from websites. It provides very fast web crawling and high-level screen scraping. It can also be used for data mining and automated testing of data.
## Scikit-learn: It is a famous Python library to work with complex data. Scikit-learn is an open-source library that supports machine learning. It supports variously supervised and unsupervised algorithms like linear regression, classification, clustering, etc. This library works in association with Numpy and SciPy.
## PyGame: This library provides an easy interface to the Standard Directmedia Library (SDL) platform-independent graphics, audio, and input libraries. It is used for developing video games using computer graphics and audio libraries along with Python programming language.
## PyTorch: PyTorch is the largest machine learning library that optimizes tensor computations. It has rich APIs to perform tensor computations with strong GPU acceleration. It also helps to solve application issues related to neural networks.
## PyBrain: The name ‚ÄúPyBrain‚Äù stands for Python Based Reinforcement Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Neural Networks library. It is an open-source library built for beginners in the field of Machine Learning. It provides fast and easy-to-use algorithms for machine learning tasks. It is so flexible and easily understandable and that‚Äôs why is really helpful for developers that are new in research fields.
## Technology Stack
1. Basic HTML, CSS, JS
2. Framework - ReactJs
3. DevOps Technology

## Git Steps
1. git flow -h (gives the list of sub commands)
2. git flow init (initializes the repository)
3. git status (shows which branch we are in)
4. git flow feature list (gives list of feature branches)
   1. git flow feature start featureName (to create a feature branch)
   2. git branch (shows the list of branches)
   3. get flow feature list (gives list of feature branches)
   4. git status (shows the list of changes made)
   5. git add . (to add all the changes at once)
   6. git commit -m "Commit message" (to commit the changes)
   7.  git log --oneline (shows the logs)
5.  git checkout develop (used to switch to specific develop branch)
6.  git flow feature finish -k featureName (used to merge the feature branch to develop without deleting the feature branch)
7.  git push -u origin develop (used to push the changes to cloud)
8.  git push --set-upstream origin featureName
9.  git flow release start 1.2.1
10. git flow release finish ‚Äìkn <1.1.1>
